# Quote Scraper

Quote Scraper is designed to scrape a Goodreads author's full list of quotes and provide this data in a usable format (then used in my project [quote-generator](https://github.com/ehhiggins37/quote-generator)). Currently, it is hard-coded for the first page (top 30) of Bren√© Brown's quotes - I may return and make this more dynamic in the future.

I used [axios](https://axios-http.com/) to make the HTTP request and [cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/index.html) to manipulate the page data to return only the quote text I wanted.

run npm start to get the array of quotes!
